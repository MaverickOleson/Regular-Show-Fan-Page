    <p id="p1">This a Fan Site dedicated to Regular Show</p>
    <p id="p2">These are the main characters, Mordecai and Rigby.<br>Mordecai is a blue jay, and Rigby is a raccoon.<br>They've known each other since childhoold, went<br>to the same school, and, after an incident where Rigby<br>tampered with Mordecai's college acceptance letter,<br>ended up both working jobs at a park, where they embark<br>on crazy adventures together.</p>
    <p id="p3">These are my favorite, characters. They show up the most often,<br>so it seems super obvious to pick them as my favorites, but<br>they are my favorites, none the less. Apart from Mordecai and<br>Rigby, who I told you about, the gumball machine is Benson, their<br>boss and manager of the park, the gorilla is Skips (formerly Walks)<br>, the pink, round headed man is Pops (like a lolipop), and the green<br>man is Mitch (aka. Muscle Man).
    <p id="p4">Season 1, Episode 12 - Mordecai and the Rigbys<br><br>Mordecai and Rigby accidentally get into a gig for a battle of<br>the bands and have to prepare, having no musical experience.<br>After spilling soda on a musical record, older versions of themselves<br>appear, apparently being celebrity musicians in the future, and they recieve<br>help from their older selves to prepare for the gig.<br>This scene is the song they perform at the battle of the bands, which<br>they turn out to have been lip-syncing to without knowing it, as<br>planned by their older selves. When they find this out, they immediately<br>swear never to turn out the way their older selves had, erasing<br>their older selves from existance. Despite not winning battle of the<br>bands, the crowd still appreciated the performance, after a speech that<br>Mordecai gives.</p>
    <p id="p5">Season 7, Episode 23 - Gary's Synthesizer<br><br>Mordecai and Rigby go to Synthos after accidentally reseting<br>Gary's synthesizer, which caused him to vanish. When they finally<br>fix Gary's synthesizer, Gary reappears and fights his half-brother<br>(as you can see in this video), David, who took over Synthos while Gary<br> was on Earth.</p>
